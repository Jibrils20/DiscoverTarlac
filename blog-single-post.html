				<h2>WHY I GREW A MUSTACHE</h2>
				<p>
					 TARLAC.  Tarlac is well known as the Melting Pot of Central Luzon due to the presence of the following four major ehtnolinguistic groups: Pampangos, Ilocanos, Tagalogs and Pangasinenses.  Amidst cultural diversities the people have learned to live as one and at peace with one another.  Thus, Tarlac served as the cradle of great men and women in every field of endeavor.

					Foremost figures were the late Benigno S. Aquino, Jr., the country’s latter-day hero and Carlos P. Romulo, the former Secretary General of the United Nations.  Another notable figure was Leonor Rivera of Camiling, Tarlac, Jose Rizal’s beloved and better known as “Maria Clara” in his novel Noli Me Tangere.

					Tarlac also takes pride in being home to the First Woman president of the Philippine Republic in the person of Corazon C. Aquino who hails from Concepcion, Tarlac.to.

				<p>
				Tarlac is the most multicultural of the Central Luzon provinces. A mixture of four district groups, the Pampangos, Ilocanos, Pangasinenses, and Tagalogs, share life in the province. 

        Tarlac is best known for its fine foods and vast sugar and rice plantations. That it has fine cooking to offer is due largely to the fact that it is the melting pot of Central Luzon. It offers some of the best cuisines from the places of ancestry of its settlers, the provinces of Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Zambales, Pangasinan, and the Ilocos Region.

        Historical sites, fine food, vast plantations, a beautifully landscaped golf course, and so many other attractions – all these make the province of Tarlac one of the best of the places to visit in Central Luzon.

					Tarlac is a landlocked province of the Philippines located in the Central Luzon. Its capital is Tarlac City. Tarlac borders Pampanga to the south, Nueva Ecija to the east, Pangasina to the north, and Zambales  to the west. That is why they call Tarlac as “THE MELTING POT”. Tarlac is a part of Central Luzon, which is composed of Pampanga, Bulacan, Bataan and Nueva Ecija.
